It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or pc, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. Just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.<br><br>The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991<br>These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

If you have a pet, or plan to get one, Blackheath Vets at the bottom of the hill will be there for you. Literally just around the corner is Mycenae House, offering a full program of arts, health and sports classes, from bridge and chess clubs, to yoga, opera, wine tasting, dancing, music concerts, and martial arts classes. There are several gyms and Blackheath Squash Club nearby.<br><br>There are lot of gorgeous green spaces nearby - Greenwich Park and the wonderful open spaces of Blackheath itself, where you can wonder over to watch the famous fireworks display in November.

There is an entrance hall, with storage and surprisingly, a loft for extra storage. Then there is a charming living room and bay window. The living room opens onto the modern kitchen which makes everything feel light. The bedroom is at the back away from the street overlooking gardens. There is a shower room with a bigger shower.

Dulwich and the popular Lordship Lane and Dulwich Village are a bus ride away as is Peckham which are all well known locally for great eating, shopping and social life.<br><br>3. Shopping, dining out and recreation. In recent years this location has become increasingly popular for recreation given its proximity to all Forest Hill has to offer.

The Sydenham and Dulwich Golf course is located next to the wood. The extremely popular Horniman Museum and gardens are located just a little further down from the woods and is now particularly popular for its farmers market and regular events (music at the bandstand in summer being one of them).

This school is found locally and there are several highly regarded schools across Forest Hill and Sydenham which offers buyers confidence in the area they are buying in.<br><strong>Share of freehold<br></strong><br><br>As you will also own a share of the freehold when you buy this property, you and the other owners will self-manage the building via a ltd company that is already in place.
