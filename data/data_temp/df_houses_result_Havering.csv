The island has storage, a wine cooler and a breakfast bar all built in and is finished off wonderfully with an inset sink and a Quooker 'boiling' tap.

With enough room for the largest of beds plus air conditioning that has been fitted recently, this bedroom definitely has a premium feel. The walk in dressing room is arguably one of the finest features in the home and features imported Italian porcelain tiles, display shelves and fitted wardrobes. However, the dressing room has potential to be returned back to a double bedroom if required.

On the composite decking area that stretches the full width of the house, the owners have built a covered outdoor entertaining space with hot and cold water supply, power points, fridge/freezer and granite worktops. On the other side of the deck is a large space for garden seating which is ideal for entertaining guests.
