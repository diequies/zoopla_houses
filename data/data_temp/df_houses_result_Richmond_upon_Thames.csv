On one occasion the police even rowed across the river to complain that his upper windows were beaconing to the far bank. He liked to watch the river and people passing in the park. He received friends here such as Joyce Grenfell, Leonard Clark, Richard Church and many another, with whom he partook liberally of tea and conversation.

He became a tenant of the Sedgwick's at South End House on the upper floor in 1940, until his death in 1956. During World War II he was officially reprimanded for failing to observe the blackout. On one occasion the police even rowed across the river to complain that his upper windows were beaconing to the far bank. He liked to watch the river and people passing in the park. He received friends here such as Joyce Grenfell, Leonard Clark, Richard Church and many another, with whom he partook liberally of tea and conversation. Sadly he was often confined indoors through illness during his final two years but positioned a mirror opposite his bed, so that he could still enjoy the fine view of Marble Hill Park.<br><br>The house occupies an enviable position overlooking the stunning open acres of Marble Hill Park, that in turn adjoins a particularly scenic stretch of the River Thames - providing a wonderful retreat from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Approached through double timber gates and set within a generous plot of just under an acre the house occupies a discrete setting, with its delightful walled gardens including a tennis court and indoor swimming pool. Also within the curtilage of Avenue Lodge and included within the sale is Avenue Cottage, an utterly charming two storey Dutch gabled cottage that was built in 1679 and is also Grade II listed. Behind Avenue Cottage there is a sizeable double garage which has a fabulous room above it, providing an ideal space for a teenagers den, gymnasium or games room.<br><br>With its stunning white rendered facade and beautifully regimented fenestration Avenue Lodge truly is a Georgian gem and this period integrity is also wonderfully intact inside, with a number of notable features including gorgeous fireplaces and a most elegant staircase. What really sets this house apart from so many of the other landmark period houses in and around Richmond is its lateral configuration. It is extremely rare to find a property of over 8000 square feet (in total) that is arranged over just two levels.<br><br>Tastefully refurbished and presented, there is a wonderful homely atmosphere and the beautiful open aspects and large windows afford a superb flow of natural light. The accommodation is practically yet flexibly configured and beautifully balanced, lending the house equally well to both everyday family life and formal entertaining.<br><br>Other features of particular note include underfloor heating throughout downstairs, three wired internet positions around the house, high speed internet connection, sky tv and solar heating panels for the swimming pool.<br><br>Whilst we can't supply all of the history of the house in this text there is more available upon request and a summary as follows : William Genew was a major local land owner who died in 1730, bequeathing his son, also William, an estate of roughly 30 acres in The Common Fields of Ham. He also owned two cottages set in around three acres, where he built Avenue Lodge and St Michaels Convent next door. In addition to his initial mortgage of £400 Genew took a further mortgage of £200 shortly after the construction of both properties was complete in 1734. However Genew had seemingly overstretched himself as by 1737 he was a 'prisoner in the Fleet for debt' and his estate was assigned to trustees on behalf of his creditors.<br><br>By 1892 Avenue Lodge had been purchased by Lord Dysart and was let to a series of short stay tenants (at an initial rent of £75 pa) of which little is known, except for a man by the name of Gilbert `a Beckett Terrell. He wrote a number of letters to Lord Dysart's agent complaining that Lord Dysart's cows got into Ham Walks (the bridle path leading to Ham House) to eat the grass but also munched holes in the hedge along his property, so that village children were able to stare in at them in their garden !<br><br>This is an extremely rare opportunity to secure a house of this calibre, history and setting and we are very proud and excited to be representing our clients as the sole selling agents.<br><br>Square Footage: 8074 sq ft","['Great period integrity', 'Laterally configured over just two floors', 'Stunning gardens', 'Swimming pool and tennis court', 'Detached Coach House']",,8 bed detached house for sale,51.436118,-0.309018,
