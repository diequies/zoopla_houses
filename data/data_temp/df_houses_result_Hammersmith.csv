The four-storey home, which has a private, south-facing garden extends to approximately 2,650 sq ft and has been the subject of an exacting renovation throughout.<br><br>The Building<br><br>‘Lion houses’ are identified by the miniature lion statues that adorn their roofs. They were built in locations across Fulham and Barnes by the Victorian housebuilder, James Nichols, around the turn of the century. The houses came in three types and were customarily built to a higher standard and in more prestigious locations than a typical Victorian terrace house, hence their demand.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>The terrace of houses is set far back from the quiet, residential street, behind a series of front courtyards. A walkway leads up to the house, passing a lightwell and a patio for the lower ground level. The house retains its original modest façade but has undergone an extensive redesign internally to create a beautiful, calm space, filled with light.<br><br>Entry is at a slightly raised-ground floor and to a large open reception area. Engineered wood flooring in rich hues runs underfoot, warmed by underfloor heating that extends throughout the majority of the house. The primary living space, on the left-hand side of the plan, is arranged around a central fireplace with a striking Corten steel-clad chimney stack and concrete plinth surround. Beyond, steps descend from the dining area to the extended kitchen, where sleek, white Corian worktops and cabinetry by modulnova are grounded by the polished concrete floor. Appliances are by Gaggenau, zug and Miele. A series of roof lights perforate the high ceilings and sliding glazed doors open to the south-facing garden.<br><br>The lower-ground level comprises a sizeable open space with exposed-brick walls and access to a patio from which light pours into the room. This space is currently used as a media room but is wonderfully versatile. To the left of the lightwell is a wine cellar, and opposite is a guest WC and utility room.<br><br>A suspended staircase with oak treads ascends to the upper levels. The main bedroom suite occupies most of the first floor and is filled with immaculate oak joinery. The bedroom itself is a calm, tonally pared-back space, providing a beautiful backdrop for the original honed marble fire surround, home to a working gas fireplace. A window seat lies beneath the wide sash windows and full-height sliding pocket doors can be adjusted to open and close the dressing area when required. Steps lead down to a generous bathroom with large-format tiling, a freestanding Corian bath and a walk-in shower.<br><br>A second double bedroom, with an en suite bathroom, is located on the level above. Here an exotic atmosphere is created by the light oak-clad walls and floors, and Louvre wardrobes. The second floor contains a study area with a custom-built desk and storage, as well as a third bedroom and a shower room.<br><br>Outdoor Space<br><br>The garden is a fantastic space for entertaining. Designed with entertaining in mind, the contemporary area has paved, concrete and decked areas, and several seating areas. The beds are filled with banana trees, evergreen fatsia Japonica and a variety of palms.<br><br>The Area<br><br>Bovingdon Road is a short walk from the many shops, bars, restaurants and cafes of Fulham and Parsons Green. In the immediate vicinity, there are several good eateries, pubs and cafes, and an array of independent shops. The excellent River Café is within walking distance.
