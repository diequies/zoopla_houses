It also puts you on the doorstep of the wonderful Wanstead Flats for the best that the great outdoors can offer.<br><br>As you enter the flat into your small entrance hallway, directly to your right you'll see the lovely bright bathroom, perfectly furnished with the essentials of WC, sink and bath, and with a handy over-bath shower for when you're in a rush. The fresh white walls and neutral bath tiles are complemented by the sense of warmth provided by the charming engineered wooden flooring. A rustic shelf over the WC also provides a handy space for your toothbrush and toiletries.<br><br>As you exit the bathroom, walk straight across the hallway to the double sized bedroom that lies opposite. The beautiful flooring continues into this space, and the large, front aspect triple window bathes the room in natural light, opening up this room even further. An unusual, quirky and useful feature comes in the form of a large recessed space - much like an internal side return - allowing a huge amount of room to purpose as a wardrobe and/or shelving storage, so you can keep the main area free of clutter. This room can comfortably accommodate a double bed, bedside unit, and drawers or a dressing table – plus there's a second recessed area that can serve as a clothes hanging area and also space for another drawer unit or even perhaps a TV table.<br><br>Heading back into the hallway and turn left into your reception… and what a reception awaits you! The two things you'll immediately notice are the immense amount of space available and the incredible sense of light. It's a real showstopper. The room features the same beautiful wood flooring as seen in the bathroom and bedroom, along with fresh, bright, white walls to further accentuate the airy atmosphere that promises many happy days and nights. With sprawling walls largely unencumbered by interruptions, this is a space that offers the flexibility for a wide range of furniture configurations – there's almost no limit. The room is easily large enough for a good-sized dining table too, for casual dinners, remote working, games nights or socialising with friends.<br><br>To the rear left of the living room is the open doorway into the wonderfully equipped kitchen, decorated in a stylish combination of white and dark grey. There's a range of base and wall units in bright glossy white, white walls and wall tiles, and mottled charcoal grey countertops and harmonising floor tiles. A washing machine and fridge are already in-situ for your move, so you can chill that celebration bottle of bubbly and keep the milk fresh for those essential brews. From the sink you can look out of the large sunny window onto the street and there's a dedicated space ready for your cooker.<br><br>While the beautiful windows in this property are not double-glazed, central heating throughout will ensure you're cosy even in the colder months.<br><br>This gorgeous one bedroom flat is also a stone's throw away from Bushwood's gorgeous green spaces, the natural expanses of Wanstead Flats and park. For those day-to-day essentials, the bustling and friendly high road is just at the top of your street, where you can access an Argos, Matalan, Post Office, a gym, a McDonald's and both a Tesco superstore and Express. Popular local pubs like The Birds and The North Star are also a short stroll away, and there's plenty of fabulous restaurants and takeaways for those days when you just don't feel like cooking.<br><br>What the owner said...<br>'i've lived in this flat for almost seven years and loved it from the start. There is a warm and relaxed vibe about the flat and the neighnourhood. I particularly love spending time in the bright and silent living room overlooking the greens of the garden. In the late spring when the sweet mock orange tree is in full bloom there is a wonderful scent throughout the flat. I like my neighbours - very nice and respectful people. Everyone in the building owns their flat and have been there for over ten years (despite being young and international) making it an unusually friendly community for London.<br><br>I'll miss immensely walking home in my street late at night and being greeted by at least two cats and sometimes a fox. It will be difficult to find a better weekend morning routine than going to run to Wanstead Flats - just behind the corner - carrying on in Wanstead park and having breakfast at the Wild Goose, a lovely local cafè.<br><br>In more pragmatic terms, i've appreciated the very low expenses associated with my flat, its convenience to the city centre (I used to work at the lse in Holborn and it took me 25 minues to get there by Central line), easy parking when I got guests, and reaching Stansted airport in 30 minutes.

The light colouring of the units, tiling and décor is offset by the sprawling black worktops and lovely wooden-style laminate flooring for a fresh yet homely atmosphere.

Come and take a look.<br><br><strong>In The Owners Words...</strong><br><br>We will miss this beautiful house filled with space and light. We initially chose it so we could hold little concerts and art exhibitions here and we’ll miss being part of the wonderfully creative E17. Our friends and family are upset that we are selling the home they also felt was theirs and we are only parting with what would have been our forever home because we are leaving London. It is a peaceful house in a street so quiet that you can sleep with the windows open, wake up to birdsong and watch the birds fledge from the kitchen window. We will miss our neighbours and feeling part of the Hilltop community that exemplifies the friendliness and helpfulness of a genuine neighbourhood. We are only the second family to have lived here and whoever lives here next will be very lucky.<br><br><strong>Dimensions:</strong><br><br><strong>Entrance</strong><br><br>Via front door leading into:<br><br><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong><br><br>Staircase leading to first floor.

Also, as with the rest of the bare floors throughout the main rooms in the property, if you wanted to forgo a carpet, you could sand and stain the floorboards for a smart, classic and cosy feel to balance out the bright and airy atmosphere.<br><br>The final and largest of the three bedrooms in this flat can be found right next door, and mirroring the layout of the reception room below, it also benefits from four windows – one to the side aspect and three to the rear. The slightly angled ceiling creates a lovely framing effect around this trio, giving this room an extra touch of character.<br><br>What this flat boasts in light and space on the inside is easily matched in terms of its location – with its close proximity to the up and coming Francis Road area, you're just a few moments away from all the shops, facilities and amenities you could wish for.

More on the local area soon, but first, let's explore the house itself...<br><br>As you approach the property, you'll see it offers both on-street parking and a gated driveway for additional security, along with a well-maintained facade. Upon entering, you'll pass through a small hallway, separated from the vast ground floor by a fully glazed door.<br><br>As you pass though into the main living area, it's hard to say what will grab your attention first, as it has so many show-stopping qualities. The incredible open-plan design of the living area and dining room offers such an impressive sense of space that you could choose almost any configuration and size or style of furniture – even the staircase leading up from the lounge adds to the airy feel. The beautiful front aspect bay window (with its stylish wooden shutters) lets in a huge amount of light – which is only added to by the French doors that lead out to the garden at the rear of the living area.<br><br>Gorgeous engineered wooden floorboards running through the space adds a classic touch to the otherwise contemporary decor, which is light, bright and accented with grey, ultra-modern radiators. Storage will never be an issue either, with an array of cleverly concealed cupboards built-in under the stairs which also offers some shelving as you enter into the dining area.<br><br>At the rear of the lounge and to the left - where the room narrows to enter the dining room section - step through the double doors and into the garden, via the spacious side-return. As you enter the main garden area there's a flagstone patio, plus an external brick-built storage cupboard for stowing away your gardening tools and kids' toys. This leads onto a large grassed area, with borders and fencing either side. Private and a real south-facing sun trap, this garden has plenty of potential and space for grown-up seating, some children's play equipment and a barbecue – whatever you feel best suits your outdoor lifestyle!<br><br>Back into the lounge and to the left, walk through into the dining space with its continued wooden flooring. Bathed in light from the large side window and the natural rays seeping in from the kitchen, there's enough room here for a large table and chairs for mealtimes with family and friends, or you could even convert this into a play area or office space. Further storage and shelving ensure your space remains uncluttered and the light decor and grey radiator theme is carried on into this area.<br><br>To the rear of the dining space you'll see the archway into the kitchen – which has been designed to utilise every available inch. The practical layout is helped along by a number of lower and wall-mounted cupboards and a considerable amount of workspace. The style is a return to the more traditional here, with neutral and beige wall tiles, light floor tiling and wooden cupboard fronts, lifted into a slightly more modern feel by the grey speckled worktops.<br><br>Heading back towards the front of the property, you'll see that the stairs have recently been treated to plush new grey carpeting, which continues throughout the bedrooms and landing areas. Up ahead and to the left as you arrive on the first landing you'll see the family bathroom, which may be small in size but includes underfloor heating and packs a real punch in the style stakes! Recently refurbished from scratch, this bathroom is bright and slick, with a modern suite and over-bath rain shower. Light white/grey tiling and some smart storage under the sink and above the WC make the most of this wonderfully executed room.<br><br>To the left of the bathroom lying to the rear of the house is one of three fantastic bedrooms. Decorated in the same cool, cotemporary style, it can accommodate a single or small double bed, or could easily be repurposed into a nursery or office.<br><br>Back down the landing you'll see another small flight of stairs leading to the upper level of this spacious house and up ahead past the large landing, you'll enter the master bedroom, with dual, front-aspect windows with wooden shutters and a view onto the lovely street.

Over the years we've seen Highams Park develop from a quiet suburb to a thriving community with great amenities, shops and restaurants of its own. And having the forest so close to hand has been a real boon during the past year of the pandemic! It really does have a lot to offer - especially for families.""","['Four Bedroom House', ""Mid Terrace 1930's"", 'Potential to Extend (STPP)', 'Short Walk to Epping Forest', '65 Foot Rear Garden', 'Moments from Highams Park Station', 'Circa 1402 Square Foot', 'Quiet Residential Location']",,4 bed terraced house for sale,51.604751,-0.005413,

The High Road is also home to the Leyton Technical, a lovely pub that occupies the ground floor of the old town hall. It has good beer, good food, and the longest walk to the toilet you'll ever find.

On Orford Road itself you will find plenty of places to eat and drink, whilst if you are in a more artistic mood, carry your coffee onwards to investigate local history at the Vestry House Museum (checking out the Ancient House along the way) or investigate all things neon at God’s Own Junkyard.

It’s called Walthamstow Village because it was once exactly that, a village. Once the administrative heart of Walthamstow, the Village is now content to simply be the neon capital of Europe.

All three businesses are based on Ravenswood, making it the most exciting industrial estate on the planet. The Village is full of quiet residential streets that all have easy access to bucket loads of pubs and restaurants. Take in the jazz at The Nags Head on Sunday afternoon, enjoy the excellent food and beer at The Queens Arms, and sample the legendary chicken and bacon jam burger at Eat17.<br>To walk off all the food you’ve eaten, wander to the 15th century Ancient House, check out St Mary’s Church and its ivy clad church yard, have a pint in the garden at The Castle Pub, then admire the art in the windows of the old iron mongers.<br><br><strong>Dimensions:</strong><br><br><strong>Entrance</strong><br><br>Via own front door leading into:<br><br><strong>Entrance Hallway</strong><br><br>Staircase leading to first floor.<br><br><strong>First Floor Landing</strong><br><br>Door to all first floor rooms.<br><br><strong>Open Plan Lounge/Kitchen</em> (5.21m x 4.80m (17'1 x 15'9))</strong><br><br>Staircase leading to master bedroom (loft)<br><br><strong>Bedroom Two</em> (4.11m x 2.67m (13'6 x 8'9))</strong><br><br><strong>Bathroom</em> (2.44m x 1.68m (8'0 x 5'6))</strong><br><br><strong>Bedroom One (Loft)</em> (5.92m x 4.57m (19'5 x 15'0))</strong><br><br><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br><br>The information provided about this property does not constitute or form part of any offer or contract, nor may it be relied upon as representations or statements of fact.
