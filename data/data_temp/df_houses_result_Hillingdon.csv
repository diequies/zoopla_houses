The district adjoins Hayes to the north and shares a railway station with the larger district, which is its post town, on the Great Western Main Line to Paddington. The Crossrail project linking the Hayes and Harlington station to Canary Wharf is due to complete in 2022. The journey time to Canary Wharf will be just 34 minutes. Other London stations will include Bond Street, Tottenham Court Road, Farringdon and Liverpool Street.<br><br>The village is surrounded by Green Belt land and open fields and also contains a parade of shops to include a Pharmacy, Co-operative Convenience store, Newsagents, a variety of restaurants and fast food outlets and a Post Office. There are also four public houses: The Great Western, The Pheasant, The Wheatsheaf, and The White Hart. The village also boasts two churches, a Baptist church and a Church of England church, St Peter &amp; St Paul's and William Byrd School. The village High Street is also home to the Harlington Locomotive Society and West London Models.<br><br>The earliest surviving mention of Harlington appears to be in a 9th-century charter in which land at Botwell in Hayes was said to be bounded on the west by ""Hygeredington"" and ""Lullinges"" tree. The first of these must be Harlington; the second has not been identified. The boundary between Hayes and Harlington, which may have been defined by the date of this charter, was later marked by North Hyde Road and Dawley Road.<br><br><em>Garage</em><br><br><em></em>","['2 Bedrooms', 'Split Level Maisonette', 'Large Lounge', 'Gas Central Heating / Double Glazing', 'Private Rear Garden', 'Garage', 'Long Lease', 'EPC Rating D / Leasehold']",,2 bed maisonette for sale,51.489712,-0.434671,
