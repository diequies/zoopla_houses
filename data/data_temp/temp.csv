This architecturally superior, early-18th century townhouse covers 3,178 sq ft across five floors with a breakfast room, internal balcony and its own private entrance – a rarity in the heart of central London. The tranquil breakfast room on the ground floor is flooded with light and adds to the sense of space. It gives residents a retreat and the building a chance to breathe. The internal balcony in the library on the first-floor surveys the rooftops of Mayfair. The red brick Georgian gem is Grade II listed due to its architectural and historic value and is worthy of its esteemed surroundings: The Mayfair Conservation Area. Over its 300-year life, This property has remained largely unchanged with period features preserved and enhanced. Wooden panelling and box cornicing was reinstated in the front reception room and library following strict guidelines from English Heritage, as have the original fireplaces. Three bays wide, the deep sash windows and generous but precise proportions, along with the decorative front door casing, give the property a dignified air.The contemporary internal amenities and luxurious modern-day touches enhance its desirability even further. There's a bespoke bar with a wine cooler, a powder room and a vaulted wine store. The kitchen is kitted out with Miele appliances and a Quoker boiling hot tap and throughout the towering property the highest quality stone masonry and materials make it sing. From the Fior Di Bosch marble walls in the principal bathroom and the smooth Bianca Eclipse Quartzite worktops in the elegant kitchen. Around every corner and in every room, there is a glorious reminder of the architectural grandeur of the Georgian era paired with cutting-edge contemporary craftsmanship.<br><br>The grand tour<br>Behind the stately wrought iron railings is the prominent private entrance to this glorious property. The standard is set at the elegant, muted blue front door surrounded by carved wooden encasing and set upon a monochrome polished tile floor. Under each of the first-floor window there are trailing, but immaculately kept, flower boxes.The monochrome marble flooring follows through into the corridor hallway which leads to a breakfast room ahead or a drawing room to the right. The latter showcases the survival of some of the high-quality original timber panelling. The front reception room has double sash box windows which look out onto the street and through this room residents can access the kitchen. The stairs lead up to the first floor and into the principal reception room with three sash windows and views of Park Street. The internal balcony that casts a backwards glance across the decorative chimneys of Mayfair and looks down into the breakfast room through a large roof lantern. The rear part of this vast reception room is the library which boasts bespoke inbuilt shelving and cabinetry and a cocktail bar.<br><br>The principal bedroom is on the second floor with its own en-suite, complete with Victoria &amp; Albert stone, resin-free standing bath, and a sizeable dressing room. Two further bedrooms featuring en-suites are at the top of the house on the third floor. All the bathrooms have electric underfloor heating and Bisque remote controlled heated towel rails to all bathrooms. The top floors are designed to be light and airy with hints of colour to contrast with the off-white envelop while the principal bedroom is painted in a subtle green hue to promote calm and wellness. Accessed through a self-contained entrance, there are a wealth of rooms on the lower ground floor: The snug bar and TV room, a fourth bedroom and bathroom and a useful utility room. The mechanics of the house can be run from the plant room, tucked away discretely on this level. The lower ground snug and bar areas are decorated with darker and vibrant colours to contrast from other areas of the house but also to promote a feeling of luxurious entertainment. The colours flow from the snug into the well cellar to create connection.<br><br>A Georgian gem<br>This house was built by bricklayer John Barnes and originally occupied by another builder John Robinson. The expertise in the hands of the team who crafted this glorious Georgian property are evident to this day: The fenestration pattern reflects the strong sense of dimension and proportion found in buildings of this era.The largest windows are found on the ground floor and first floor which were deemed to be the most important parts of the house, where guests were received, entertained and business done. It is believed the staff slept on the third floor where the windows, although in the same width and style, are shorter. Landscape painter wj Poole once lived at the house between 1817 to 1822 with builder Thomas Poole. Other characters of note include Amy Frances Apthorp who resided at the property in 1904 when she registered a patent for a device for attaching feathers and plumes and other such decorations to hats or bonnets.<br><br>The significance of Park Street<br>The construction of Park Street, on land owned by Grosvenor Estate, dates from 1720 to the 1770s. It is the longest street in Mayfair and runs from Oxford Street down to South Street and runs parallel with Park Lane. In the early 19th century, some rebuilding on the street took place along with the development of corner plots. During the latter part of the 1800s more extensive rebuilding took place with substantial private houses being constructed on the east side. The area retains its conservation status due to his rich architectural legacy and high volume of listed buildings an essential component of the charm of Mayfair. This recently restored home makes an important contribution to the heritage townscape not only through its individual stature but also through its visual relationship and general homogeneity with its neighbours. In fact, numbers 70 to 78 are the only surviving early Georgian homes on Park Street. A string of dignitaries and members of the aristocracy have resided on Park Street over the last few centuries. They include Sir Rufane Donkin, a lieutenant general in the British Army and serving officer in the Napoleonic Wars, and Albertha Spencer-Churchill (1947 – 1932) also lived on the street. She was the daughter of James Hamilton, the 1st Duke of Abercorn, and was married in Westminster Palace to George Spencer-Churchill, eldest son of the 7th Duke of Marlborough.<br><br>Life in Mayfair<br>The whole of Mayfair is designated a conservation area. It is a wealth of the architectural spoils of the Georgian and Victorian eras, of leafy streets and pretty squares. Originally it was part of the manor of Ebury before ownership was transferred to Westminster Abbey prior to 1087 and then to the Crown during the reformation. Part of these lands became Hyde Park and the rest was sold off to various private parties. During the 17th century the growth of London shifted towards the west end which became, and remains, the focus of fashionable life in London.Park Street runs parallel with Park Lane and the string of internationally-acclaimed, historic hotels which sit opposite the 350-acre green expanse of Hyde Park. Just a few minutes' walk south from Park Street and residents will arrive at Grosvenor Square. This once ambassadorial square is now home to some of the finest modern developments in the world encased in traditional architecture. Due to open in 2024 is the Chancery Rosewood hotel, the reimagined the us Embassy. There's a string of Michelin Star restaurants on the doorstep of Park Street from the formal, three-star Alain Ducasse at the Dorchester or the contemporary one-star Hide with views over Green Park. The theatre district of the West End is close at hand, and even closer are the fashion houses and boutiques of Bond Street and the art galleries of Cork Street. The new high speed Crossrail service will start running this year through Bond Street with quick links to Heathrow and the City.<br><br><strong>What3words /// </strong> worry.script.glaze<br><br><strong>Notice</strong><br>Please note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.

The skylights flood the hall and stairs with light all day as well.<br>The location - I can walk to Portobello Road market in 10 minutes, to High Street Kensington in 40 minutes and to Little Venice in 15 minutes. There are three tubes within 10 minutes' walk, Maida Vale, Warwick Avenue and Westbourne Park. The bus routes are also really good - it takes 15 mins to Camden, 20 mins to Oxford Street, 30 minutes to Euston (depending on traffic). And it takes under 10 minutes to get on to the A40. There a loads of lovely local restaurants and shops, Paddington Recreation Ground is around the corner and is a wonderful open space with outdoor gym, running track, cricket pitch, cafe and children's playground. There is a real sense of neighbourhood and community. And space! It sounds silly but the roads are lovely wide boulevards with trees and broad pavements, a rare thing in London.<br>The space - before my sister and I saw this flat we were almost on the point of giving up; two-bedroom flats in London are really one-bedroom flats with a box room. This flat is not that, it has two big double bedrooms and, after we did the flat up a few years ago, it now has two bathrooms. Plus a big sitting room and a super well laid out kitchen if you like to cook. The hob is smeg gas - it is possibly my favourite thing in the flat! And there's an enormous attic for storage, which has allowed me to expand my shoe collection beyond all sense. The stair case in the hall combined with the skylight makes the whole flat feel huge and airy. Plus, there is a small courtyard garden at the front which we share with the other flats in the building.<br><br><em>Three things we love about the area...</em><br>Cochonnet, the local Italian restaurant. It's been there forever and has a cult following among residents in the area. Plus the food is delicious.<br>Little Venice - the canals and waterside pubs and restaurants are just lovely for walks and gentle meals to while away a Saturday afternoon.<br>The neighbours - my neighbours living in the other flats in this building are all lovely and we see each other regularly. The people in the area are also really great, I have made lots of local friends having met people in nearby pubs and also in Paddington Rec, the local park, and Tamplin Mews, the park at the end of the road.<br><br><em>Q&amp;A </em><br><em>Why are you selling?</em><br>I have lived here for 15 years and have loved it but I got a lockdown puppy and she needs a garden. And i'm ready to move out of London.<br><br><em> What's the area like?</em><br>Extremely nice, very middle class and in some directions very full of financiers. There are a lot of Ferraris, Aston Martins and enormous electric four by fours. Local butcher, chi chi groceries and delicatessens, coffee shops and bakeries plus some excellent fine dining and more relaxed pubs, my favourite is The Waterway which has an open fire in the winter and deck on the canal for summer. Maida Hill is less investment banker territory and more ordinary people going to normal jobs, it's relaxed and friendly. The people who run the local shops know me and have even lent me cash when I lost my bank card a few years ago. Good schools and nurseries also and lots of green open space.<br><br><em>What is parking like? </em><br>There's always space to park on the street, very occasionally i've had to park around the corner. There are now at least six ev charging points on Grittleton Road, and three pay and display spaces. Parking is free at the weekends and the resident permit area extends all the way up to Swiss Cottage and St John's Wood high street.<br><br><em>How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? </em><br>It's not a main road though sees a reasonable amount of traffic during rush hour. At night it's quiet, though it is still London so the odd siren is to be expected. The bedrooms are double glazed though which mostly deadens any noise.<br><br><em>I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property?</em><br>I live alone here so use the second bedroom as a study as I work from home most of the time. I have had two of us living and working from home here as well though, which worked well. She used my study and I was set up in the living room.<br><br><em>What's the internet like? </em><br>Very good speed, I have Sky and the wifi is strong plus I use an extension which takes the hard wire internet to the downstairs bedroom where I work so Zoom calls never drop off.<br><br><em>What's the boiler like?</em><br>Potterton Gold, fully serviced every year, in very good condition.<br><br><em>Are we able to do any work/extensions?</em><br>Subject to the freeholder's agreement and planning permission, I would have thought so yes.

It's housed within a remarkable building that was once part of the Warwick Farm Dairy.<br><br>In its 19th Century heyday, the site supplied milk to Queen Victoria - and the structure exudes historical charm. The exterior is just as it appeared in adverts of the time: It still has the same large windows, as is immediately apparent upon opening the front door of this welcoming apartment. You enter into a strikingly light-filled room that has been exceptionally refurbished to incorporate traditional features into a stylish decorator scheme - light colours and contrasts are used throughout to conjure a modish edge. Yet you never lose the sense of place. Take the capacious master bedroom: Sunlight cascades in through an attractive bow window that's set into the building's corner turret.<br><br>Indeed, light and space are the defining motifs of this flat. It has windows on three sides which, coupled with wide streets to the south and west, produce a wonderfully bright environment. And the floorplan isn't limited to the bare essentials - there's also a sizable laundry room, a rare luxury in central London, and an outside terrace.<br><br>Walk around the apartment and you'll find splashes of modernity, but these are focussed where they most earn their place: The kitchen, bathroom and showeroom. The refurbishment of these areas was carefully informed by current interiors trends. They embrace clean lines and minimalist fittings, but stand out, like the rest of the property, for their sophisticated use of colour. The dark blue and mustard of the shower room, the pink walls of the bathroom and the chic black of the kitchen fittings are set off beautifully by the neutrality of the other spaces. The design work is full of clever detailing, such as the way the handles of the kitchen units blend away against the cupboard doors, or how the statement beading around the bathroom tiles quotes the black lines of the taps.<br><br>From the windows, you can gaze down onto the attractive environs of Maida Vale. Little Venice is but a 10 minute stroll away; you can get to the green expanse of Paddington Recreation Ground, a Conservation Area of 27 acres, in around five. The flat is also approximately eight minutes from Maida Vale tube station and around 15 from Westbourne Park.

Completely bespoke, it was sanded, stained and polished by hand on site; its chevron pattern creating a chic sense of attitude and continuity throughout the space. And what a space. With two bedrooms, a bathroom, a shower room and the huge living area, it already spans 1,151 sq ft - but the shrewdly designed sight lines between the rooms make it seem 20 percent bigger. This is enhanced by the leafy trees outside, and the views down to the playing fields of Vincent Square.<br><br>Those playing fields are a splash of countryside in the middle of town and speak to the village-like quality that residents love about this neighbourhood. The area is full of independent shops, local restaurants and quiet residential streets. Yet it's also a stone’s throw from the purr of central London life. You can amble to the West End in twenty minutes or to the tranquility of St. James's Park lake in fifteen; you can be at Victoria station in under ten.<br><br>It's such an inviting prospect, that many prospective buyers find themselves accepting properties with obvious drawbacks. This flat is not one of those - everywhere you look, clever design touches help it perform at its best. Take the door to the living area, which folds back flush with the wall to create a perception of flow into the entrance hall. If you do wish to shut it, however, it reveals a stylish bookcase built into the wall. And then there are the aesthetic elevations that show just how much care has got into every detail: The Carrara marble kitchen worktop has been sanded to create an inconspicuous gradient down to the sink; the grain across the Macassar ebony kitchen cabinets runs straight from one to the next; the artworks on the living room walls are picked out by individual spotlights.<br><br>The whole environment is so agreeable that, for everything that's on the doorstep, it might just become your favourite place in town.","['Underground parking', 'Double glazing', 'Porter/security', 'Wood floors', 'Lift']",2 bed flat for sale,51.493457,-0.137717,107.0,2,2,1,2021-09-10T15:46:09,1495000.0,,,

It would be bright, smartly laid-out, replete with storage, and finished to the utmost level of quality. It would, in fact, be just like this beautiful, high-ceilinged apartment three minutes from Green Park tube station.<br><br>Step inside and the first thing you notice is its sunniness. Its orientation is ideal - the bedroom faces east, the reception west - and it is blessed with an enormous six-lite bay window. This not only floods the living room with light but makes for a stylish design feature in its own right. The place also feels wonderfully enabling. Many West End flats suffer from awkwardly shaped nooks and crannies, or unusably long corridors, but in this property not a single square foot is wasted. The sense of space is only amplified by the large mirrors in the reception, and the sight line that connects it across to the bedroom.<br><br>The property holds secrets that extend it yet further. The double bedroom has ample cupboards, but panels open to reveal even more storage. Or take those reception room mirrors. You would never realise to look at them, but the one on the right is actually a door. Slide it away and it reveals an exquisitely finished kitchen - the continuation of the grain from one cupboard door to the next is something that can only be achieved when the units have been made bespoke.<br><br>This emphasis on quality is the defining feature of the flat. Its very fabric, from joinery to stonework, has been elevated to the nth degree. The custom-made floor, for instance, is superlative: It was all sanded, stained and lacquered on site. Or look at the fireplace. The regularity of its horizontal lines look almost man-made but it is actually completely natural, lovingly crafted from sumptuous striato marble. The effort that has gone into the interior extends even to the smallest details: The dark bronze electrical fittings, say, the fine cornicing, and the dark wenge wood detailing that stylistically unites the mirrors and the bookcases. It is Mayfair through and through.<br><br>The building itself is no different. The flat is on the top floor of a proud, Victorian red-brick building with a grand central staircase (and a lift, of course). It is also a classic Mayfair address - Algernon Moncrieff in Oscar Wilde's The Importance Of Being Earnest famously lives on Half Moon Street - and a stone's throw from all the major touchpoints. The road connects with the quieter end of Piccadilly to the South, leading straight onto the calm of Green Park. In seven minutes you can get to Mount Street, where you'll find restaurants such as Scott's. And for a lower key evening, you can always head around the corner to Shepherd's Market, a little enclave of pubs and restaurants that seems to evade the attention of the tourists.<br><br>See?
