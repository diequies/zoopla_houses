Caledonian Road offers an array of amenities, with nearby Upper Street offering further stylish shops, bars and restaurants.<br><br>Comments from the owner:<br><br>Top three things we love about this flat…<br>• The location is ideal. We are both continually in and out of town for last minute jobs and meetings and the transport links from here are superb. We have the overground next door, plenty of buses at the end of the road. It's an 8-minute walk to Cale underground, and about 12/15 minutes to Highbury and Islington. Granary Square has been a revelation - such a beautiful area to enjoy. With the fantastic restaurants, boutique stores, and The Everyman Cinemas it's become a much frequented and special place for us. It's great for the kids, with the fountains running throughout the summer. We have the classy stores and bars of Upper Street just a stone's throw in the other direction and I can vouch for the quality of the nearby fantastic gastro pubs; The Albion, The Drapers and The Crown to name a few.<br><br>• The quiet! Yes! My home is my sanctuary. Being on the top floor obviously means no footsteps overhead. It is a very sociable flat, - and we've had some great evenings in our big kitchen/ dining/ living space but, I really wouldn't have lasted this long in a block if my peace had ever been lastingly disturbed. You can come anytime of the day or evening, and you'll hear no loud music in the building, no party people. As far as outside is concerned, the speedbumps rooted out any speed freaks along Wheelwright St, and, besides, the double glazing throughout the flat does a marvellous job closing off any traffic noise and makes our home a really cosy peaceful place. Yes, we have the prison view one side, but all our living is done in our front rooms that overlook the courtyard, and the view is long out of our huge window and lovely to look out on from our swing chair of a morning. When I walked in here in 2007, I never believed it would be thirteen years before I thought of leaving. I've shared the space with flatmates, and i've lived on my own here for several years, feeling entirely secure. And ultimately it has become our family home.<br><br>• The layout has been perfect for us. It is certainly not a pokey flat. The rooms are a good size, and it's very bright and spacious. Great for entertaining. I'm most proud of our beautiful new kitchen and I put a lot of thought into the planning of that space to ensure everything was at my fingertips. The storage is great in the cabinets, which are not too high! The little coffee bar is one of my favourite spots to perch, and it's useful having the extra bit of storage on that side of the kitchen. I also knocked through the bathroom and created a lovely internal private space away from the living area. And i've recorded plenty of professional voiceovers during lockdown from my little studio I created in what used to be a storage room - completely soundproofed and tranquil.<br><br>What we love about the area:<br>Right on our doorstep is the renowned café; Sunday, for which there is always a queue around the block on weekends. We love strolling over there and getting our little sunspot at the front on weekday mornings. Amazing food - People travel from far and wide for that place. And, if the queue is long, Southpaw is a great new addition on Roman Way - lovely people who also serve a proper coffee. Plus, a little sneaky Thai Corner in the fabulous Irish boozer, The Hemingford is not to be sniffed at.<br><br>Why are we selling?<br>We simply feel we've outgrown the place. We are a growing family and feel the time has come for a total change of scenery and we're heading out of town. It's a tough decision because we can honestly say we have been extremely happy here and will be very sad to leave.<br><br>What is the parking like?<br>There are parking bays available in The Close. My car is directly opposite the back gate. Very useful and not expensive. There are also two guest spots available, and you can get your free permit from Islington Council.<br><br>We're currently working from home; how does that work in the flat?<br>I'm a voiceover artist and have been professionally recording throughout lockdown.<br>Recording for TV requires a high-speed, very secure broadband and i've been able to keep a steady workload with no problems. We signed up for PlusNet and it's been great.<br><br>What's the boiler like?<br>We have a Valiant combi boiler that is two years old. We only ever switch on the heating in the winter, and then, only to wake up to, and at our children's bath time. The heating is fantastically efficient and the water pressure perfect. They pumped a whole lot of insulation into the building about five years ago, and it is always warm inside our flat.","['Second Floor Purpose Built Flat', '2 Double Bedrooms, 1 Bathroom', 'Light and Spacious Accommodation with Stylish Interiors', 'Large Reception Room and Separate Well Equipped Fitted Kitchen', ""Bonus Fully Insulated 'Sound Room'"", 'Close to Caledonian Road &amp; Barnsbury, and Highbury &amp; Islington Stations', ""Moments' From Fashionable Shops, Bars and Restaurants"", '75.4 sq m / 812 sq ft']",,2 bed flat for sale,51.544121,-0.115199,Just added

Thornhill Square was begun in c 1847 with a Mr gs Williams building 33 houses on the west, the central gardens having railings dating from c 1852. Thornhill Crescent was begun in c 1849.<br><br>Early residents of the square were well-to-do professional classes. In 1906 two of the houses in the north-west were demolished for the new Islington West Library designed in Art and Craft style by E Beresford Pite. As the C20th progressed, the area became run down like much of Islington and in 1955 the family interest died out with Captain Noel Thornhill. The central garden was only open to keyholders until 1946 when Captain Thornhill donated the gardens to the public and they were opened by the Mayor of Islington in 1947. They were newly laid out in 1953 under the Council's Open Spaces Scheme as part of Coronation Year improvements. Thornhill Square is a large ovoid ellipse square surrounded by railings and a great curiosity in plan. Surrounding buildings are largely intact. St Andrew's church, built in 1852-54, is to the north of the Square within Thornhill Crescent gardens&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;","['1042 Sq.Ft/97 Sq.M', 'Share of Freehold', 'Three Double Bedrooms', 'Two Luxury Bathrooms', 'Double Reception Room', 'Spacious Separate Dine in Kitchen', 'Private Patio Garden', 'Barnsbury Conservation Area']",,3 bed flat for sale,51.541313,-0.114507,

The result is a series of flowing spaces that reflect the honesty and integrity of their materials.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>Entry is on the ground floor, where a staircase ascends to the first-floor communal areas. The L-shaped plan has been exploited on this level to allow for two large balconies; the west-facing balcony has the house’s defining external feature, a conservatory with a large vertical section of glazing above that extends to the second floor. The steep pitch of this glazed section not only allows wonderful levels of natural light to stream into the first and second floors, but also echoes the linear sections of glazing on the penthouse level. The conservatory is currently used as a winter garden and is a wonderful spot for breakfast year-round.<br><br>The kitchen adjoins the conservatory; this is a calm, considered space with birch plywood cabinetry and space for a dining area.

The larger bedroom has plenty of built-in storage space, while the smaller has a large section of sloped glazing with wonderful views.<br><br>The penthouse makes up the third floor. Currently configured as a second living room, it also has a WC and a second kitchen. As per Lynch Architects’ instruction, it was constructed offsite and craned onto the existing structure, along with the many glass panes that run around its edge.

The south-facing garden is an incredible sun-trap that transports you to a warm, tranquil place far away from the hustle-bustle of London. Feeling the sun on your face while watching goldfinches and blue tits as you drink a coffee is an incredible way to start a weekend. A small shed is a perfect place to store the charcoal you will want to have on hand for impromptu bbqing with family and friends. The double doors that lead outside welcome sunlight throughout the flat, making it feel bright, airy and warm. In the summer, a curtain of wisteria makes the space feel even more magical.<br>2. The bathroom was designed with the help of an Islington firm to create a sanctuary with the feel of a sauna. The use of bespoke tile, wood and mirrors creates a room that feels both rustic and modern at the same time. Reading lights over the bath allow you to relax with a book and forget about the stresses of the day. The heated floor keeps the room cosy, even in the winter, and a heated mirror over the sink means you can easily have a shave after a shower. A pocket door hides a washing machine, tumble dryer and loads of storage shelves. A water softener protects your skin and hair as well as your appliances from London's hard water. There is also a massive amount of storage under the sink and countertop so you can keep everything tucked away.<br>3. High ceilings and original features provide a unique, spacious and welcoming feel to the property. White-oiled oak floors from Ecora bring a fresh, modern look to the flat. With spacious gardens to the back and a quiet road to the front, it is a peaceful place to live. When sitting in the lounge, you hear birds instead of traffic. You will feel miles away from London even though you're a three-minute walk from the Canonbury overground and a ten-minute stroll from the Highbury &amp; Islington tube stop.<br><br>Three things we love about the area.<br>1. There are many green spaces just a short walk away. From Highbury Fields to Newington Green to Clissold Park, it's so easy to have a weekend amble.<br>2. Running errands feels so much more managable when the clerk at the Post Office asks about your day, the owner of the corner shop waves every morning and the owner of Vins knows exactly what wines you will love. It's easy to pick up provisions for a picnic in the park near Newington Green (cheese from Jumi, charcuterie from Yield N16 and pastries from Jolene or Belle Epoque) or Highbury Barn (cheese from La Fromagerie, Italian snacks from Da Mario and fruit from Mrs Lovell's Greengrocers).<br>3. The Canonbury overground stop offers two lines, making it easy to get to places like Hampstead Heath, Stratford and Canada Water, while the Victoria Lina and trains from Highbury &amp; Islington provide even more opportunities. The area offers supurb public transport connections while still feeling quiet and calm.<br><strong>Q&amp;A<br></strong><br><br>1. Why are you selling? After 11 years in London, I have decided to move to be closer to my parents and sisters. It's a tough decision because it's hard to say goodbye to the flat.<br>2. What's the area like? There's a true community feel to the area. I know many of my neighbours quite well and we even share keys to each other's homes so that we can look after pets and plants when someone is on holiday. During the first lockdown, I discovered one of my upstairs neighbours is a chef when his wife let me know via a WhatsApp text that he had made too much Thai curry. Minutes later, she had left a pot of incredible food at my doorstep.<br>3. What is parking like? Parking is very easy. I've never struggled to find a space.<br>4. How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? The road is generally quiet, especially at night.<br>I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property? The second bedroom is big enough to serve as an office/gym combination. It has been so nice to literally shut the door on work at the end of the day.<br>5. What's the internet like? I have Virgin Media and it has been okay.<br>6. What's the boiler like? I've never had any issues with my Worcester boiler and have it serviced regularly serviced by Joanna, the local plumber who seems to look after most of the properties on Grosvenor Ave. She is incredible!<br>7.

In 1945 she received - and rejected - an unexpected proposal of marriage from her neighbour George Orwell, recently widowed and then living with his young son Richard at 27b Canonbury Square. (Olivier described Orwell’s flat to James Beechey, a contributing author of 'The art of Bloomsbury' as being on the floor directly below hers.)<br><br>In 1952 Olivier married the art historian and writer Quentin Bell, the younger son of Clive and Vanessa Bell, and moved with him to Newcastle, where he was then teaching. (Quentin would later write the authorised biography of his aunt, Virginia Woolf, and Olivier subsequently edited the five volumes of Woolf’s diary.) Her mother-in-law Vanessa and Duncan Grant moved into 26a Canonbury Square in October 1952 and it remained their London address until the summer of 1955. Grant, in particular, made a number of paintings there (including several nudes of his friend Paul Roche) and occasional meetings of the Bloomsbury group’s Memoir Club were also held in Canonbury Square.<br><br>The 2016 article in The Guardian on Olivier Bell, mentions the Canonbury Square flat.<br><strong><br></strong><br><br>*26 Canonbury Square is accessed from a gate entrance on Alwyne Villas. Access to the apartment is from the garden level at the back of the building. From this point there are two flights of stairs, which takes you to what is the corresponding first floor when viewing the property from the front.","['Elegant and charming first floor flat', 'Beautifully presented', 'Two double bedrooms', 'Long leasehold - circa 119 years remaining', 'Stongly believed to be once the home of Duncan Grant &amp; Vanessa Bell members of the renowned Bloomsbury set']",,2 bed flat for sale,51.543464,-0.099517,

With all-day sunshine and a lovely view of the park, relaxing in the front room is a dream. We love cooking in an open-plan setting, meaning we can prepare meals while catching up with friends. Having two good sized bedrooms has meant we can have guests at the drop of a hat while also having ample space for home-working, something that's been essential recently. We also love our comfy bedroom which benefits from two windows for fresh air in the summer and soft morning light. Abundant storage in the loft and floor to ceiling cupboards is another plus in a relatively small footprint meaning we never feel cramped and can keep the place neat and tidy. Finally, the park is our giant front garden where we've enjoyed BBQs, strolls, sun bathing and of course, the outdoor gym. <br><br>Why are you moving? <br>Having just got married, we are now looking to grow our family so we're looking for our forever home nearer to the sea. <br><br>What do you love about the area? <br>We've both lived in all four compass points within London but the Finsbury Park and Stroud Green area is where we most feel at home. The tube station provides quick and easy access to both major London airports in under an hour and the West End or City is 30 minutes door to door. Stroud Green Road has our favourite shops and restaurants, from Mustpha at Green and Glory to the guys at Deli at 80, micro-brews at The Brave Sir Robin and the tastiest coffee and cake at Big Jo, we have everything we need right on our doorstep. We are also extremely close to a lot of unspoilt nature in the Parkland Walk, Highbury and Queens Wood and the expansive views from both Alexandra Palace and Parliament Hill, all within walking distance. In addition, we have been able to take part in growing the community garden which is literally opposite our front door, bringing us closer to the community and making new friends. It's been our fabulous home for four and a half years and it will be with a heavy heart when the time comes to say goodbye.<br><br>Property Details:<br>Accommodation comprises entrance hall with two inbuilt storage cupboards, leading into the bright and spacious, open plan reception/kitchen with ample space for both relaxing and dining, and flooded with natural light from dual windows overlooking Wray Crescent Park.
