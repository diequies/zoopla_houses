This house sits at the end of the terrace, among the estate’s sprawling communal gardens, with a south-facing balcony and patio garden.<br><br>The Building<br><br>The houses that form Cottenham Place, referred to as the Copse Hill estate by Nikolaus Pevsner, are an excellent example of the thoughtful, early 1960s developments that were inspired by the success of Eric Lyons’ Span estates, which are known for their considered design and beautiful gardens. These houses were a luxury development by Wimpey Homes; they were admired by Ian Nairn a few years after their construction in Modern Buildings in London for their “sensitively landscaped surroundings”. This house was bought by the current owners in the 1960s and is one of few to retain its original fixtures and fittings internally. As such, it requires some modernisation.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>The house is positioned at the top of the estate, at the end of a sloping road winding through the terraces to the peak of the hill. There is a private drive, which leads down to the lower ground floor internal garage. There is a secondary front door at this level that leads to a utility room with its original fixtures, a storeroom and a wonderfully bright hobby room, which could be used as a fourth bedroom. This space has sliding doors that open directly onto the garden.<br><br>The main entrance is at raised ground floor level, where beautiful five finger parquet runs underfoot and an open-tread staircase connects the three levels. To the left is the kitchen, which retains its original, soft grey-hued lino flooring and joinery, as well as a hatch into the dining room. The living room at the rear of the plan has further modern detailing, including a 1960s fire surround, and sliding doors that open onto the balcony, which has recently been restored.<br><br>Upstairs, there are three bedrooms, the largest of which has incredible views through a bank of full-width windows, as well as an en suite bathroom. The other two bedrooms and family bathroom can be found off the bright central hallway. The bathroom retains its original tiling, which reflects the considered natural palette of wood and grey tones found throughout the house.<br><br>The Area<br><br>Wimbledon is one of London’s most attractive areas, with its large, open green space of Wimbledon Common and the renowned restaurants, cafés and boutiques of the historic Wimbledon Village.

They were reassured that we would be safe on such a pretty, tree lined, well lit, off road private estate with green spaces as well as being well maintained throughout.<br><br>The area was and still is to this day, quiet and peaceful with great neighbours. An added bonus is the allocated parking space that comes with the flat, provided in the car park outside the block. The location is great as you can easily access buses taking you into Colliers Wood or Tooting after a short walk to the bus stop outside the development.<br><br>My sister and I both bought properties near each other again in 2003 and the flat was sold to a family member as an investment property. I was then lucky enough to be able to repurchase the flat back in 2008 and returned having fallen in love with it again. I moved back in after completely renovating the kitchen and bathroom as I was due to marry and this flat became our first marital home.<br><br>The flat was freshly decorated in early 2021 and we had new UPVC doubled glazed windows installed throughout 5yrs ago.<br><br>Being share of freehold ensures there is a lot of control regarding the overall costs relating to the external building and ground maintenance costs. There is full transparency regarding how our very reasonable service charge is spent every year and the reserve fund. There’s a lot involvement in choosing any new cleaning and maintenance contractors and any rear issues arising are quickly resolved as the external areas of the flats are managed by the residents association and the contracted Management company are easily contactable. We are kept well informed continuously.<br><br>The flats were fully externally decorated late last year after we reviewed the bids received for the work; ensuring the estate remained well presented. This year, we have plans to extend the lease as we are the freeholders to a 999 year lease with only legal fees to pay of less than £1000 while still maintaining share of freehold status. The communal areas are cleaned weekly with the grounds and car parks well maintained monthly.<br><br>It was and still is the ideal flat for commuting with excellent transport links: 5-10mins away from Colliers Wood, bus stop is 2 mins away or 10mins if you prefer to walk. Well connected with a central bus stop hub in Mitcham Town Centre with buses. Tram Stops are also a 10-15 walk away taking you into Wimbledon Mainline Station or West/East Croydon within 20mins, as well as Mitcham East fields Train Station getting you into Clapham Junction Mainline Station and Victoria in under 20 mins after a short bus ride or 20mins walk.<br><br>The Flat is also well serviced with excellent amenities nearby. We have great shopping in Mitcham Town Centre as well as an Asda. In Colliers Wood there is The Savercentre with M+S, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Tandem Shopping Centre providing Next, Sports Direct, tk Maxx, WHSmith and Boots. There are 2 Lidl's and Priory Retail Park with Aldi, pc World and Dunelm all within a short walking distance. There is also a doctors surgery across the road. Several Gyms including Nuffield Gym with Jacuzzi Pool, swimming pool and Sauna as well as several other gyms offering 24/7 access.<br><br>Merton Abbey Mills is a short walk away which has great shopping, pubs, bars and restaurants to explore and enjoy as well as great Summer outdoor concerts. Merton Abbey Mills is a place of historical significance that is well worth a look around with bespoke boutique shopping, Children’s Theatre and Live Music Events including Outdoor Jazz in the long summer nights.<br><br>We are also spoiled with green open spaces with National Trust Morden Hall Park a short walk away as well as several Parks and open spaces that are safe and clean with sports Courts for those interested in outdoor exercise.<br><br>We have lived in in this lovely flat for over 10yrs and we have had many happy years here as a couple.
