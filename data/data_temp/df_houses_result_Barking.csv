If you do not have your own surveyor, we would be pleased to recommend one. We have not checked whether any equipment in the property (such as central heating) is in working order and would advise homebuyers to check this. You should also instruct a solicitor to investigate all legal matters relating to the property (e.g. Title, planning permission etc., ), as these are specialist matters in which estate agents are not qualified.
