Located between two private walled gardens, the house capitalises on its location in exquisite style, surrounded by wildlife and the bucolic outlook of Hampstead Heath, with delightful views of the boating and swimming ponds beyond. Originally built in the 1830s, Apex Lodge was the former lodge of Fitzroy Park, an estate owned by Baron Southampton.<br><br>The Building<br><br>Since its construction, Apex Lodge has had two modern architectural interventions. The first adaptation took place in the 1980s creating a conservatory and kitchen. Latterly, a beautiful spiral staircase, second floor and balcony were added by Oliver Barsoum of Syte Architects. Both adaptations of the plan riff on the home’s characteristic pitched roof of the original lodge building, introducing lower-level allusions to this feature alongside subtle higher-level inversions of the profile.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>Apex Lodge is wonderfully positioned at the foot of Fitzroy Park, a private road and one of Highgate’s finest lanes, maintained by the residents’ association. Set between two beautiful walled gardens, the house presents a grand three-storey façade, crowned with an elegant pitched roofline that emerges through the treetops. There is space for two cars to park on its drive and a separate garage with ample storage space.<br><br>Upon entry, the modern architectural interventions are immediately apparent. The entrance hall is bright and voluminous, linking the two separate wings of the ground floor plan. Along the southern aspect are a cleverly conceived dining room and kitchen, which open out to a secluded walled garden and terrace respectively, overlooking Hampstead Heath. The kitchen lies beneath a glazed pitched roof, set within beautiful Iroko frames. As the roof becomes mono-pitched, the glazing continues, allowing natural light to pour across the room; it resounds off custom stainless steel units, granite worktops and Siemens appliances. The orientation and morning light make this space a perfect breakfast room.<br><br>The adjoining dining room, of the original 1830s lodge, feels like a natural extension of the kitchen. A wonderful space for entertaining, this also has a dramatic pitched roof that creates a palpable sense of volume. A Welsh slate fireplace sits to one side, opposite a set of glazed doors which open out to the secluded garden and patio. A guest WC can be accessed from both the dining room and the entrance hall.<br><br>The northern wing of the ground floor is occupied by two glorious reception rooms. The smaller of the two rooms has a bay window overlooking the Heath to the west and the garden to the north; it is currently used as a music room. The main reception room is an expansive space, defined by a playful circular conservatory with a beautiful concrete pillar at its centre. It opens via several glazed doors onto the largest section of the garden, breaking down the boundary between inside and out. A living area with garden views takes up the rest of this room.<br><br>The first floor comprises a main en suite bedroom with an adjoining dressing room, two further double bedrooms and a family bathroom. The main bedroom looks over Hampstead Heath’s bird sanctuary pond and its dazzling population of native kingfishers, while the peaceful third bedroom has views of the garden’s mature Monterey pine tree.<br><br>The upper floors are accessed via a fantastic spiral staircase with open-tread oak steps and a curved steel balustrade. This architectural feature allows natural light to cascade across all floors with a dramatic effect. The top floor of the house is a fantastically flexible set of spaces. A further bedroom and bathroom can be accessed via a bright and airy room, which the current owners have used variously as a home office, playroom and as an additional living room. There is also a storage room in the eaves. A large skylight sits over the staircase and a set of glazed doors open to a balcony with elevated views through the treetops, charmingly framed in a V shape by the meeting point of the roof’s two pitches.<br><br>Outdoor Space<br><br>Apex Lodge has verdant views in every direction. The ‘front’ garden is actually located along the lodge’s southern aspect; it is formed of a secluded patio dining area that flows naturally from the dining room’s glazed doors, and a small pond with raised beds of mature plants and shrubs. This space is private, peaceful and perfect for alfresco dining in the warmer months.<br><br>A flagstone terrace runs around the western aspect of the lodge, elevated from the Heath below by a brick wall. The main garden opens out along the northern aspect and is mostly laid to lawn, with shade provided by a mature Monterey pine tree.<br><br>The Area<br><br>Apex Lodge occupies a fantastic position on the very edge of Hampstead Heath, overlooking the Heath, the Bird Sanctuary Pond and the Model Boating Pond. The Heath offers freshwater swimming year-round in the nearby men’s and ladies Bathing Ponds, as well as some of London’s most beautiful woodland walks.

The area is perhaps most renowned for its association with the bohemian group of 20th-century writers and artists including Virginia Woolf, Vanessa Bell and E. M. Forster, known as the Bloomsbury Set. It is one of London’s most desirable neighbourhoods, characterised by stately residential squares and its proximity to University College London, rada, the Architectural Association and Senate House Library.<br><br>Museum Street itself has its origins in the 14th century; however, it remained largely rural until the late 17th century when London greatly expanded. This included the establishment of the British Museum in 1753. In the early 19th century, the street became a fashionable area, with many prominent writers of the day gathering in its taverns, including Charles Dickens, John Keats and George Orwell, as well as the Bloomsbury Set.<br><br>The Grand Tour<br><br>The apartment is configured around a large open-plan kitchen, living and dining room lined with solid oak floorboards. Five beautiful arched sash windows frame exceptional views through a row of London Plane trees, towards The British Museum piazza. High ceilings and a curved aspect emphasise the flow of natural light across the plan, which illuminates the solid oak joinery and black Zimbabwean granite worktops. The kitchen is positioned at one end of the plan and has integrated Gaggenau appliances, oak-fronted units and plenty of storage space.<br><br>A large main bedroom with an en suite shower room lies off the main hallway. These spaces have been the subject of a sensitive intervention by John Griffiths, who has created bespoke shutters in poplar wood for each of the three arched sash windows in the bedroom, as well as refurbishing the shower room, which is now partially lined and fitted in beautifully aged teak.<br><br>Opposite is the second bedroom, used by the current owners as a home studio.

Lisburne Road is minutes from the green spaces and swimming ponds of Hampstead Heath, as well as the amenities of Hampstead Village and Belsize Park.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>The house presents a typically Victorian façade to the street, with an elegant redbrick bay on the ground floor and full-height glazing on the second floor. Set partially back from Lisburne Road, behind a small front garden, the house forms part of a charming terrace running south from Hampstead Heath towards Belsize Park. Upon entry, a truly modern approach to space, light and flow is apparent. The finest contemporary materials have been used and the overall configuration of the house has been thoughtfully enacted with modernist principles firmly in mind.<br><br>The kitchen can be found at the front of the house, nestled within the grand bay window; this has a window seat and an unbroken sightline that extends to the foot of the garden. This arrangement allows natural light to spill across the plan, resounding off the beautiful marble floors and sleek Corian worktops. The linear nature of the striated marble further accentuates this sense of seamless flow. Adjoining the kitchen is a cosy breakfast room with a marble fireplace and a pocket door leading to the hallway and cloakroom area.<br><br>Arguably the most impressive space is the large open-plan living and dining room, which is positioned three steps down from the kitchen and breakfast room. This area is fantastically bright, illuminated by light that streams in through a long row of skylights over the dining area. It extends out towards the back garden via an area that the current owners refer to as “the conservatory”; a living space with large-scale skylights above and glazed doors that open directly to the garden patio.<br><br>The first floor comprises three double bedrooms, each with built-in wardrobes. The largest of the three occupies a wonderful position at the front of the house, with two large sash windows that draw in natural light from the west-facing aspect. There is also a large family bathroom on this floor.<br><br>The main bedroom and en suite occupy the entire top floor. High ceilings and a mono-pitched roof with two skylights ensure these spaces are exceptionally bright and airy, and there are built-in wardrobes which provide ample storage space. The en suite has marble tiles arranged in a herringbone pattern underfoot, as well as marble micro-tiles on the walls, twin sinks and a freestanding bath.<br><br>Outdoor Space<br><br>The east-facing garden is mostly paved, surrounded by raised beds with mature plants and shrubss. The current owners have set up two seating areas, one just beyond the conservatory’s glazed doors and another just outside the beautiful garden studio. This versatile space is perfect for a home gym, study, or even an artist’s studio. It has glazed doors oriented towards the house, as well as running water and electricity.<br><br>The Area<br><br>Lisburne Road is situated just three minutes walk from the open spaces of Hampstead Heath, and is a short walk to the shops and restaurants of Hampstead Village and Belsize Park. The fantastic Parliament Hill Lido is within five minutes walk. Nearby are the independent retailers of Fortress Road and the weekly farmers’ market at Parliament Hill. The boutiques and restaurants of Hampstead are within easy reach, while just across the Heath is Swains Lane and its wonderful array of shops, including Bourne’s Fishmongers, Fam Greengrocers, Primrose Hill Butchers and Gail’s.

It is tucked away at the end of a gated cobbled mews in the middle of Primrose Hill, combining privacy and security with the convenience of a village location.<br><br>Eglon House provides more than 13,000 sq ft of beautifully crafted live/work accommodation, composed of two interlinked buildings, set around a private courtyard and joined at basement level.<br><br>The house has been designed with flexibility in mind, and many of the spaces would suit a variety of uses. It could be used as a dwelling, as a commercial building, or as a combination of the two. It would work equally well for a family requiring guest/staff accommodation as it would for an art foundation requiring premises with significant spatial drama.<br><br>The larger, eastern, side of the building has an industrial character, with exposed concrete ceilings and surface-mounted services. At its centre is a magnificent double-height grand salon, with a galleried level containing a professional kitchen and dining room. The first floor offers more than 2,000 sq ft of space, currently configured as a breathtaking master bedroom suite, and the second floor contains an extensively glazed ‘orangery’ that would work particularly well as an office.<br><br>The western side of the house has a more intimate, domestic scale and an Art Deco atmosphere. The ground floor opens out onto the courtyard, with a double-height living room and a kitchen. The first and second floors contain three bedrooms, three bathrooms and a study. There is a further bedroom and bathroom in the basement, alongside a remarkable swimming pool that doubles as a cinema room, with a mechanical floor and waterproof screen. A lift services all of the floors.<br><br>The original Maison de Verre (1928-32) has been described as an elaborate piece of furniture, reflecting Pierre Chareau’s expertise as a product designer, and this craftsman’s sensibility has carried through to Eglon House. This is a project six years in the making. British materials are much in evidence, including a staircase made from pitch-pine and grout mixed with Portland stone. Elsewhere, Lebanese cedar is combined with elegantly patinated Italian marble. There is museum-grade bronze track lighting, the walls have been reinforced to take heavy artworks, and even the fire extinguishers have been custom-made.<br><br>Eglon Mews has a location that is simultaneously discreet and convenient. The shops and restaurants of Primrose Hill Village are around the corner, and the open spaces of Primrose Hill and Regent’s Park are a short walk away. Chalk Farm Underground station (Northern Line) is just across the bridge. Many of London’s best schools are within close proximity.<br><br>The site has always had a commercial use. A mid-19th-century census map shows a series of stables and barns, where shell casings were manufactured during the First World War. Express Dairies then used it to service their floats, at a time when cattle were still grazed on nearby Primrose Hill. In the 1970s, it was converted into Mayfair Recording Studios, where hits by everyone from Tina Turner and Pink Floyd to The Smiths and The Clash were made.<br><br>Although Eglon House settles into the outline of the original structure, it is an entirely new building. Inspired as a homage to Pierre Chareau’s Maison de Verre, this backland site, which has the character of a Parisian mews, was appropriate for a forward-thinking contemporary house imbued with the same Modernist spirit.<br><br>Pierre Chareau’s ‘House of Glass’, completed in 1932, was a milestone in early modern architectural design. It was a pioneer of the modern-day live/work phenomenon, with commercial space on the ground floor and living accommodation above. It was commissioned by Doctor Dalsace, who hosted Surrealist soirees in his salle de sejour, which were attended by Jean Cocteau, Joan Miro and Yves Tanguy. The close proximity of other buildings dictated a transparent façade. The iconic glass blocks, which shatter the light like lenses, have been recast for the western façade at Eglon House.<br><br>Eglon House takes its cues from Chareau’s original in a number of other ways as well. The design emphasises an honesty of materials, variable transparency of forms, and juxtaposition of ‘industrial’ fixtures with a more traditional style of home décor. Some of Chareau’s furniture and light fittings have been sourced and applied in appropriate areas. Thirties construction methods were used for the exposed shuttered concrete ceilings in part of the building, and there are visible structural elements, just as in the original, such as exposed steel beams with expressed mechanical bolts. The blue carpet in one of the bedrooms is exactly the same colour as that used in the Maison’s master bedroom, alongside other carpets and rugs inspired by artists of the era, such as Ben Nicholson and Alexander Calder.<br><br>Despite these similarities, however, Eglon House has been largely created by English craftsmen and adopts an entirely contemporary approach. On the top floor, for example, solar pv matting is set into the triple-glazed roof lights, so that it simultaneously reduces the glare and generates energy. In the basement, the ingenious mechanical rising floor allows the room to act as both a swimming pool and a cinema. The 3m-wide LED waterproof movie screen was specially commissioned and, at the time of fabrication, was the highest-resolution example of that size ever made.<br><br>&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amenities:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Freehold, Swimming Pool, Double Height Feature Living Room, Flexible Accommodation, Resident Parking",,,5 bed detached house for sale,51.541167,-0.156423,

The ucl, lse and King's University are also within close proximity.<br>The nearest Underground stations are Tottenham Court Road, Leicester Square and Covent Garden; with all the major tube lines, along with the main cross rail terminal at Tottenham Court Road with easy, direct access to the City of London and Heathrow Airport.<br><br>Vendors Comments:<br>""We've loved living here on Phoenix Street. After being in the West Village of New York for years, we wanted a place that was walking distance to everything but on a quiet, leafy street. We rented the apartment for 4 years before our landlord finally relented and agreed to sell to us... We're only selling now because we're moving to Brazil!<br>The location is really special - right in the centre between Soho and Covent Garden. Such a luxury to take an impromptu stroll on a warm summer's evening down through St Martin's Lane and Trafalgar Square to the river, around St James Park and and back through Mayfair or Soho for dinner. I can't count the number of times we decided to get theatre or cinema tickets 10 minutes before curtains up, waking out our door and straight into a production. So cool. I also really enjoy my 15 minute morning's walking commute to the office over on Berkeley Square - there's a really peaceful, neighbourhood vibe to Soho before the city comes alive. In terms of nature, there are beautiful old sycamore and maple trees right outside the flat and a stone's throw from the front door is the stunning oasis of Phoenix Gardens. You can't quite believe this place exists - full of the most beautiful plants and natural, flowing landscaping, it's the perfect place to meditate, read a book or have a picnic. I use the lawn there every morning in the summer as my own personal yoga space (it's very zen!). In terms of groceries, Whole Foods, Marks and Spencers, Waitrose, Tesco's and Sainsburies are all easy walking distance, with a large Boots Pharmacy just up the road.<br>The building itself is modern, incredibly well built and really friendly with just 9 other apartments. The cut of the flat feels perfect with just the right amount of space apportioned to each room, and the third floor location provides for light and a nice view. We created a discreet home cinema in the sitting room (which we probably used too much, ordering delivery from the endless restaurants in the neighbourhood) and the kitchen/dining room area is the perfect space to entertain in, especially with the flat's new integrated sound system. We've loved having central air conditioning in the summer and a terrace with a view of the gardens - we have lots of happy memories of evenings with friends with the barbeque going and a glass of wine. In the winter the heated limestone floors and walnut detailing always made the place feel natural and warm. Oh and it's very nice to have a large elevator for when you don't want to take the stairs!<br>Finally the fact that we own shares in the building as well as having the leasehold always provided a level of comfort and security in the longevity of our ownership - a rarity in Central London. My one caution for potential purchasers would be that you might find yourself suddenly very popular with friends and family that want to come stay!""<br><br><strong>Notice</strong><br>Please note we have not tested any apparatus, fixtures, fittings, or services.

Designed by Charles Canning Windmill an architect of the London County Council Architects Department, it was awarded its Grade II* listing by English Heritage over 40 years ago, being described as “one of the most distinctive and original of a remarkable series of fire stations built”. Seen as a clever interpretation of an Arts and Craft-style house, Belsize Park Fire Station is set on a generous plot and was sensitively designed to blend in to its residential location, noted for the many spacious Victorian and Edwardian homes lining the surrounding leafy avenues. The elevation to Eton Avenue resembles a row of terraced cottages with its tiled roof and tall chimneys while the view from Lancaster Grove is of the stone clad appliance bay frontage with its huge glazed doors, steeply pitched roof and tall hipped dormer windows. Belsize Fire Station completed almost 100 years of service before being decommissioned in 2014. Fire crews from the station worked tirelessly during the two world wars, keeping the service running throughout the London Blitz from 1940 to 1941. Crews from the fire station also attended the 1987 King’s Cross fire and the 7/7 bombings in 2005.<br><br>Important Note:<br>1.
