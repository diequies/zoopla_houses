""I have lived in this road for 20 years and will be sad to leave. My kids have grown up here, going to Churchfields school, which is just a short walk over the bridge. When they were old enough it was lovely to be able to let them walk to school on their own, secure in the knowledge that once i'd seen them across the road there were no roads to cross. As the road is a cul-de-sac our children always felt safe to play out with their friends. They had water pistol fights in the Summer, Snowball fights in the Winter and Wynndale is famous for it's Halloween celebrations. The neighbours really are a lovely bunch. We have an active WhatsApp group, where we exchange useful information about issues affecting the road, recommendations for tradespeople and organise social activities. During lockdown we had a socially distanced D Day celebration party. The nicest compliment people pay me about my house is that it has a lovely feel. It is flooded with natural light, even on the gloomiest days. In the morning I like to sit with my cuppa in the sunny breakfast room with the French doors open, looking out at my garden, listening to the birds. We're not over-looked and there are many trees around - hence the birdsong. Another favourite space is my light and airy bedroom, with wall to wall windows.<br><br>It's really big so plenty of space to do my yoga! I love the fact that the station is a ten minute walk through Elmhurst Gardens, which is great for kids and dog walking.

A smart 1930s build with whispers of period charm amid the very modern decor, you have an amazing 1600 square foot of living space, not including two unique outbuildings. A beautifully bright property full of delightful surprises.<br><br>Your garden hosts a studio annexe as well as an incredible wood cabin, making for astonishing amounts of extra room for storage, guests or where ever else your imagination wanders, without compromising at all on garden space. Indoors there's so much space to play with, so you'll never want for a place for things, from the practical to the precious. To top everything off there's a beautifully converted loft too.<br><br>If you lived here…<br><br>You'll step into your welcoming hallway and find your double reception to the left, with over 325 square foot of sociable space. A large curved bay window bathes it all in light, and soft grey carpet gives way to grained engineered flooring underfoot (recently newly installed throughout this storey). An exposed brick chimney breast overlooks the dining area, where double doors lead to your 160 square foot kitchen, with central breakfast bar island and grand double oven.<br><br>Through sliding aluminium patio doors you'll find your garden, a delightful outside space with large patio. The first of your amazing outbuildings is your cabin of 245 square foot, a perfect place for guests to stay under a wood-panelled ceiling and overlooked by a mature willow tree. Should you wish to use it as a garage you can potentially arrange rear access, as some of your neighbours have done. To the side is your wonderfully flexible studio annexe, over 130 square foot with shower room, WC and its own generous covered deck. Both ideal for all manner of purposes.<br><br>Back through your hallway, past a downstairs WC and utility, you'll find your way upstairs. Your shower room is first on the right, with two windows to throw lots of natural light onto the bright white space. There's a modern white suite featuring a Villeroy &amp; Boch sink and Brittany shower. Then you'll come to your first bedroom, 105 square foot with a view of the garden and soft grey carpet underfoot. Your second bedroom is 160 square foot, with another glorious big bay window. Blonde engineered flooring lies underfoot and the walls are pristine white.<br><br>Next along is your third bedroom of just over fifty square foot, perfect as a nursery or a study. Up in the converted loft, specifically designed for extra headroom, you'll find two more bedrooms and another shower room, with vanity sink and smart marbled tiles. One bedroom of ninety five square foot sits to the rear, with a Juliet balcony set in a wall of windows to take in the views. Your last bedroom offers 160 square foot of bright space, lit by a pair of skylights. There's plenty of eaves storage here too.<br><br>It's just twelve minutes' walk to Woodford Station, where the Central Line will take you to Stratford for shopping at Westfield in another twelve minutes, or to Liverpool Street in just over twenty. All your amenities are close at hand, including a wide range of sports clubs from bowls to cricket and rugby. Drivers will be pleased to find it's barely over three miles to the North Circular and the M11, making getting around or out of town a cinch.

We have hosted many large celebrations in our garden, up to 100 people, however the noise does not carry to the front area so never had any issues with neighbours. Parking for guests could be found in surrounding areas. Similarly internally, with the solid structure downstairs walls we never hear our neighbours nor noise carrying from the ground floor to the top. We had our Scottish family and friends and lots of visitors from around the world benefitting from our large accommodation and perfect location hence why we added further external accommodation. WiFi access has been installed inside to the top of the house and out to the chalet/ bothy - excellent fast service throughout. The street is very quiet both with a mixture of long term elderly owners and new family’s with young children with very little houses being rented to tenants, unaware of any HMO property’s. The children’s parks and facilities are very close and safe allowing them to walk or bike themselves. My kids did local paper rounds in the morning, a very safe area. Then as they got older part time and summer jobs were found easily around the area.<br><br>Latterly my husband and two boys worked in central, I don which they found the central line one of the best tube lines for access, comfort ability and speed. The supermarkets are both in walking distance and Waitros is in driving distance. Excellent restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance. Excellent walking oathyps and access to the forest close by. A wonderful place to bring up young children. For me, I raised teenagers who managed to safely access all sports facilities and their excellent school Davenant by bus. There is an easy frequent bus service to throughout north and east London and Walthamstow Central as well as tube service and trains from Stratford to throughout England. Two excellent acute hospitals very close; Whipps and Northmid with private Holly house also close. Excellent doctors surgery’s and dentist in walking distance in Woodford. We will be sad to move from this wonderful family home but will continue to live around this area as love it so much.""","['Five Bedroom Freehold House', 'Large Loft Conversion', 'Large Kitchen Diner', 'Large Rear Garden', 'Annexe/Summerhouse', 'A Further Large Log Cabin', 'Close to Woodford Station']",,5 bed semi-detached house for sale,51.601634,0.036312,
