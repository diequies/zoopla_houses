Configured across four storeys, it was designed by Leonard Manasseh for the lcc in the 1970s as the street-facing focal point of the Arden Estate. The house, which has two large balconies, has been the subject of an ingenious extension in recent years care of Lynch Architects, who used the penthouse floor as their design studio for a number of years.<br><br>The Building<br><br>The aesthetic of the building, particularly the prefabricated penthouse addition, was developed against the trend of British high-tech architecture, which favoured layers of glazing and steel cross-bracing. Instead, a largely natural palette of materials has been used; timber frames and birch plywood ceilings not only create a sense of warmth but also serve as structural alternatives to heavily manufactured materials. The result is a series of flowing spaces that reflect the honesty and integrity of their materials.<br><br>The Tour<br><br>Entry is on the ground floor, where a staircase ascends to the first-floor communal areas. The L-shaped plan has been exploited on this level to allow for two large balconies; the west-facing balcony has the house’s defining external feature, a conservatory with a large vertical section of glazing above that extends to the second floor. The steep pitch of this glazed section not only allows wonderful levels of natural light to stream into the first and second floors, but also echoes the linear sections of glazing on the penthouse level. The conservatory is currently used as a winter garden and is a wonderful spot for breakfast year-round.<br><br>The kitchen adjoins the conservatory; this is a calm, considered space with birch plywood cabinetry and space for a dining area. Linoleum floors run across this level and beautiful exposed copper pipes run along sections of the wall. The balcony at the rear faces north towards the Arden Estate; it is accessed via a set of glazed doors which open from the living room.<br><br>The second floor contains two bedrooms and a family bathroom. The larger bedroom has plenty of built-in storage space, while the smaller has a large section of sloped glazing with wonderful views.<br><br>The penthouse makes up the third floor. Currently configured as a second living room, it also has a WC and a second kitchen. As per Lynch Architects’ instruction, it was constructed offsite and craned onto the existing structure, along with the many glass panes that run around its edge. Oak mullions frame each section of glazing, as well as breathtaking panoramic views of the city beyond. The windows and roof light open to create natural ventilation, while the rooftop lantern acts as a solar chimney.<br><br>The Area<br><br>The house is positioned on Hoxton Street, which was the centre of the Shoreditch furniture and carpentry trade in the 19th century.

Its character &amp; design - modern and quirky with all the mod cons, but also a really homely feel. Being spread over three floors with its own front door also makes it feel like a true mews house.<br>2. The glass feature walls and roof box mean it's always flooded with natural light, as well as feeling cosy and private.<br>3. Having our own outside space, looking out over the rooftops of East London.<br><br>Three things we love about the area.<br>1. All the streets around London Fields and Broadway Market full of independent shops, breweries, bakeries, a great butcher and fishmonger, loads of coffee shops/roasteries, delicious restaurants like Bright and Nest, and our favourite old pub The Dove, as well as various food markets on weekends<br>2. Transport links - London Fields overground station a few minutes walk away, loads of bus routes from Mare Street, vibrant Hackney Central 10 mins away, and then Bethnal Green on the Central line the other direction<br>3. Beautiful Victoria Park 10 mins walk away, all of the canal routes for cycling, and 15 mins by bike out to Hackney Marshes for more open green spaces<br><strong>Q&amp;A</strong><br><br>1. Why are you selling? Bought as a shared purchase between siblings but now looking to move on to our next homes<br>2. What's the area like? Really vibrant and creative, full of independent shops and businesses as well as relaxing green spaces<br>3. What is parking like? Always loads of spaces just outside and the adjacent streets, easy to get a residents' permit and guest permits. We also have excellent wall-mounted bike locks installed in the Bayford Mews entrance way, behind the secure gate<br>4. How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? Not busy at all, no issues with noise<br>5. I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property? We turned the downstairs bedroom into a home office for lockdown (with a sofa bed for when we're allowed guests again!), but also happily work in the living area, the 2nd bedroom and even on the roof when it's warm. There are also loads of co-working places (The Fisheries, Second Home, We Work to name a few) around here if you feel like a change of scene.<br>6. What's the internet like? Super fast fibre (our contract is with BT 70 mb)<br>7. What's the boiler like? Vaillaint combi boiler, less than 4 years old<br>8. Are we able to do any work/extensions? Haven't investigated, but as you own the freehold do have lots of flexibility<br>Ref: Isl","['Small, award-winning development', 'Mare Street Conservation Area', 'Three double bedrooms and two bathrooms', 'Open plan, kitchen &amp; reception rooms', 'Underfloor heating', 'Private roof terrace', 'London Fields on the doorstep', 'Titan hrv air filtration', 'Sq Ft/M: 1,029 sqft / 95.6 sqm']",,3 bed maisonette for sale,51.539808,-0.057003,

The location. It's cultured, fun, but also has miles of beautiful green space and it's so quick to get anywhere. It's a really peaceful flat, despite being so close to Homerton Hospital, as the ambulances don't use sirens outside and park on the other side of the estate. The community on the estate is really lovely, especially the immediate neighbours who came round when I moved in to bring me a cuppa before I had a kettle, and have taken signature for more packages than I can count. The allotments and communal green spaces with roses and lavender make the place feel homey.<br>2. This is an unusually large, bright flat for the area and it feels really spacious inside. I have a kingsize bed and it doesn't feel cramped in the bedroom, plus there is loads of storage all over the house. It's also south facing so you get nice light in the living room and kitchen all day.<br>3. The thing that attracted me most to the flat when I saw it was the unusual dining space in-between the kitchen and living room. It is a cozy little nook and so nice for small dinner parties, but also great to work in during the day as it feels so light and bright. There is potential to knock this area through to make one big open plan kitchen living room, or just a bigger kitchen, but I think it's a nice, unusual feature.<br><br>Three things we love about the area.<br>1. The flat is very central and right in the middle of lots of great places. I can cycle into Oxford Street in 35-40 minutes, and it's only 7 minutes walk to Homerton Overground, (from which it's a 7 minute train ride to Stratford International &amp; 9 minute ride to Highbury and Islington) and it's close to Clapton and Hackney Central Stations too. The area is very well served by buses too. Parking is available at the apartment and you can get guest scratch cards from the council which are cheap and straightforward to use - and ensure you can always find a parking spot.<br>2. I love how social the location is. The flat is 2 minutes walk from Chatsworth Road, which has lots of lovely coffee shops, cafes, restaurants, and a 1920s style Art Deco cinema and cocktail bar called The Castle. The Adam and Eve &amp; Eagle pubs do great food and lots of space for big group gatherings, and there are lots of very lovely restaurants including Krapow, Jim's Cafe and Silver Linings close by too. When I lived elsewhere, I would travel miles to get to these restaurants - they're that good. Hackney Wick and Dalston are both 10 minute cab rides away and have great nightlife and clubs, and you have the Moth Club for comedy, the Hackney Empire theatre, and the Picture House for film all in walking distance.<br>3. It's also very close to lots of green space and nice walks. Millfields, Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, Victoria Park or Hackney Marshes are all in walking distance. It's weird that you can have somewhere so central and in 10 minutes be somewhere that feels almost like the countryside (Walthamstow Marshes are a 10 minute cycle up the canal). I'm looking to buy my next house in the same area...<br><strong>Q&amp;A<br></strong><br><br>Why are you selling? Because my partner and I are looking to buy a flat together with a second bedroom ;)<br><br>What's the area like? I love this area, I grew up here and I have lived all over but always come back because it's so full of life, greenery and culture.<br><br>What is parking like? Very good. I don't have a car but parking is available at the apartment and you can get guest scratch cards from the council which are cheap and straightforward to use - and ensure you can always find a parking spot.<br><br>How busy is the road, is it quiet at night? Very quiet - It's a really peaceful flat, despite being so close to Homerton Hospital, as the ambulances don't use sirens outside and park on the other side of the estate. The house is off-road so not much noise at all!<br><br>I'm currently working from home, how does that work in this property? It's nice to have a few possible areas to work - I like to work in the living room and the dining area but there is also place for a desk in the bedroom or a 2-person table in the kitchen.<br><br>What's the internet like? I have the highest speed internet on the market as I need it for work - v fast upload and download speeds and actually very inexpensive, only £26 a month.<br><br>What's the boiler like? I replaced the boiler and electric circuit board when I moved in 2 years ago to the most energy efficient and reliable ones available.<br><br>Are we able to do any work/extensions? You'd have to apply for planning permission from the council but other flats have done this with no issues. I was planning on knocking through the bathroom and toilet which you would have to get permission to do. You could also knock through the kitchen and dining area or even the kitchen, dining area and living room to make one big open plan space! Other flats with the same lay out in the block have done this. I got a quote to replace kitchen, toilet and bathroom and knock through the toilet and bathroom and it came to around £10k - so not a big cost to really make it your own.<br><br>Property Details:<br><br>Accommodation comprises a wide entrance hallway with side aspect window and storage/seat under, leading into the bright and spacious reception room with ample space for relaxing and dining.
