We're delighted to present this wonderful, completely refurbished three bedroom house, ideally located in Stratford. Chandos Road is within easy reach of Leyton High Road, Leyton tube station, and plenty of open green spaces nearby. It's a perfect place for those looking for a welcoming community and easy commuting opportunities.<br><br>This spacious home lies opposite the lovely Chandos Road Gardens, providing immediate access to a beautiful outdoor space complete with an extensive play area - fantastic for young families. Approaching the end-of-terrace house, you'll find a walled front garden space, with a wrought metal gate, and vehicular access to the garage is reached from the rear of the property, via a service road.<br><br>Entering the house, you're met with a light carpeted entranceway, and a staircase leading to the first floor. Immediately on your right is the front aspect reception room, which looks out onto the street. With high ceilings, white walls and beautiful flooring, this room is light and stylish, and has ample room for both a lounge suite and dining set. In keeping with the fantastic and thorough refurbishment, all of the internal doors are newly fitted and elegantly tasteful.<br><br>In this generously sized living/dining room there's also a useful inbuilt cupboard, a useful space for stowing away toys, equipment or for any storage requirements you may have – plus a shallow and unobtrusive chimney breast housing a black fireplace without disrupting the lovely lines of the room. Towards the rear left of the reception room is an entrance to the kitchen, with the room extending further to the right, down to a chic set of sliding patio doors that open out onto the garden. This dual-aspect room ensures that you'll get the best of the sunlight, any time of day.<br><br>As you enter the kitchen, you're immediately taken by the bright and sleek décor and fittings; the white floor and wall tiles and shining kitchen units emphasise the amount of natural light that is able to flood the space. The white units are overlaid with a smooth black countertop, emulating a discreet sense of modern sophistication. A large inbuilt cupboard and plenty of overhead cabinets also allows for helpful storage space. This spacious, functional and well laid-out kitchen comes complete with a glossy new fridge-freezer and inbuilt oven and hob, alongside some super-handy adjustable shelved units. It's the perfect space for cooking up a family meal or dinner for your guests, and completely read to move into. This room also features a back door for additional access to the garden, and a dishwasher and washing machine are also included.<br><br>Moving out into the garden area you'll see that it's been almost paved, with a small bed to either side – low maintenance but with a little patch for some pretty flowers, shrubs or even grow-your-own vegetables. It's an excellent outdoor social space, with more than enough room for a coffee table, outdoor sofa set, picnic bench, barbecue… even some kids' toys.<br><br>The garden also provides foot access to the red brick garage: A super convenient addition to the house. It's large enough to comfortably accommodate for a family-sized car or could even potentially be repurposed into an annex or office in the future if you wanted to expand.<br><br>Back inside, let's head upstairs and onto the landing space, where straight ahead is the smallest of the property's three bedrooms, which offers a lovely garden view and plenty of natural light. This cosy space could function as a child's bedroom or a study, a playroom or a small guest rom. All of the bedrooms are finished with the same lovely light beige carpet, and the walls have all been freshly painted a bright, brilliant white.<br><br>To the right of this bedroom is the entrance to the second, an excellent guest bedroom or child's bedroom, whatever works for your family or lifestyle. This room also looks out onto the patio garden, and includes a fashionable inbuilt floor-to-ceiling cupboard.<br><br>The master bedroom is just to the right of the landing, and has a gorgeous view overlooking Chandos Road Park. Spacious and bright, this room has more than enough space to fit a double-bed, wardrobe, bedside table and more, and is also fitted with floor-to-ceiling cupboards to help you stow away all your gear. It truly is a fantastic space to make your own, all freshly decorated for an airy atmosphere, with the option to put your own mark on it should you wish.<br><br>Next to the master bedroom is the family bathroom, newly fitted to the highest standards. The neutral stone-style flooring adds a touch of warmth to the white bathroom suite - consisting of WC, sink, bath and over-bath shower - and the immaculately stylish white and grey marble-effect tiling throughout the space. The feature heated towel rail is an added bonus and as with the rest of the property, it's a lovely bright room.<br><br>Ultimately, this three bedroom house in Stratford is the ideal home for any new family, couple, or individual looking for some space. The recent refurbishment has blessed the house a lovely modern feel, with contemporary and welcoming rooms.<br>While certainly impressive internally, the property is also extremely desirable for its location. Tucked away from the main road, there's a sense of space and tranquillity, but in reality every daily need can be met within minutes of your front doorstep. Leyton tube station, Maryland overground and Stratford International are all within walking distance, plus there are several local bus routes to get you anywhere you need to go.<br><br>The Dew Drop bar and The Eagle pub are both local favourites, and Leyton High Road is choc-a-block with cuisines from all over the world - there's really something for everyone here, whether you want to eat in or grab a takeaway. For those who like to get in touch with nature, Wanstead Flats are a short journey away, and the property is also within a close distance of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Also super handy is the close proximity to Westfield Shopping Centre for that all important retail therapy.<br><br>With such a fabulous location and impressive interior, what's stopping you having a look at this wonderful property for sale in Stratford?

The sense of space where the Thames stretches to almost a mile wide, and the broad flat land of the docks opens up great expanses of sky, is like nowhere else in the city. Either side of Royal Wharf there are large parks, adding an even greater sense of natural openness. To the east is Lyle Park, opened in 1924 by Sir Leonard Lyle. To the west are the 22 acres of the award-winning Thames Barrier Park, filled with fountains, lawns and flower gardens, as well as a children play area and sports facilities.<br><br>Together with Royal Wharf Gardens, there will be a world-class fitnessclub, fully equipped to meet the varying needs of everyone at Royal Wharf.

You can be at Bond Street in 20 minutes; and the O2 in a little over five.

The orientation of the house means early morning sunshine pours through the large rear window/sliding doors (3.6m wide x 2.4m high) and the evening sunshine comes through the large bay window at the front of the house. When we bought the house we knew straight away that the spatial layout should take advantage of its unique east-west orientation, and the long visual aspect of not having any houses on the opposite side of the road. We also carefully modelled the location of two large roof lights so that we could bring even more natural light deep into the middle of the house.<br><br>A key design move was to create a series of spaces within the same room, which was achieved by having a step from one area to the next. This also allowed us to create generous head heights between the spaces, and a lighting design that enhanced the sense of three different volumes. This approach also allowed us to create a variety of storage solutions and enough deep storage for either a pushchair or a bike to simply roll in.<br><br>We loved entertaining in the house and enjoying the large kitchen island with its bespoke ceramic stone finish. The garden design and planting have been inspired by the nearby Wanstead Flats and the plants have been chosen so that there is a point of interest no matter the season. The length of the garden means it's a lovely spot to sit and enjoy every minute of the evening sun.<br><br><strong>Why are you moving?</strong><br><br>We moved abroad in 2018 and have been renting the house out since then, but we have now decided that's time to sell so we can buy something where we are currently living.<br><br><strong>What do you love about the area?</strong><br><br>Living on Ridley Road is a bit like the best of both worlds - it is a stone's throw from the open green space of Wanstead Flats but equally, it's a short walk to Forest Gate's town centre, including Forest Gate and Wanstead Park train stations, so it's peaceful but also really well connected. From Forest Gate, trains take between 10-15 minutes to Liverpool Street and even less to Stratford, and it will be served by the Elizabeth Line when it's fully operational in 2022.<br><br>Forest Gate itself has a great community and the town centre has everything you need day-to-day. There's a market that takes place every Saturday and a thriving community garden on Earlham Grove, as well as some amazing independent businesses in the railway arches along nearby Cranmer Road and Winchelsea Road including cafes, bars, restaurants and a yoga/ pilates studio.

The juliette balcony and big windows lets the sun flood in, making it a very warm and inviting space to relax in. The convenience of having 2 bathrooms makes it very comfortable for when guests come over to stay. The spare room can be used as a guest bedroom or spacious office. Ideal when friends and family stay over or those working from home. The flat is best suited for a young family or a couple. We are active people and the secure bike shed downstairs within the building, is a god send when storing our bikes.<br><br><strong>Why are you moving?</strong><br><br>We are looking to upgrade to a house with a potential to convert the garage into a gym. Being a personal trainer under lockdown, the gym is sorely missed.<br><br><strong>What do you love about the area?</strong><br><br>The transport links are a massive plus. The flat is within walking distance to 4 train stations - Stratford International (6mins to Kings Cross or trains out to Kent and beyond), Maryland, Stratford and Leyton tube stations (jubilee, central lines, DLR and various overground routes in and out of London). There are 3 bus stops just down the road or around the corner of the flat.

Two local parks are downstairs from the flat and The Olympic Park, just 10mins walk away. Great for outdoors exercise, picnics, park runs or simply a stroll. All very well maintained and with facilities for all free to use. E.g. BBQ sets, cafes, table tennis, children climbing frames.<br><br>Within the Olympic park is the Velodrome for cycling or the aquatic center for swimming. There are plenty of gyms to choose from with Anytime Fitness, only 5 mins away or Better Gym in East Village, the Aquatic Center or Copper Box.<br><br>East Village and Westfield shopping centre is literally down the road with many bars, restaurants, dog friendly cafes, shops, butchers, supermarkets, cinema, banks, bowling alley and much more. Great place to enjoy and have a good shop then stop for a bite to eat or drink with friends. It's a family friendly area too with plenty of entertainment within the shopping centre or playgrounds, climbing walls, and open space outside in the parks.<br><br>For sophisticated dining, I would recommend the Stratford Brasserie within The Stratford hotel. Ideal for those special occasions. For a more relaxed environment, you have plenty of restaurants to choose from. The neighbourhood is great for juicy BBQ chicken and the weekly pub quiz.<br><br>For culture, the Stratford theatre is in the Old town, also within walking distance.
