Perfect for summer BBQs or working from home in the sun. 3) The layout. Each room is on a slightly different level, giving the flat real character and a sense of space. No 2 rooms adjoin, so when we have guests staying it's large enough to have a sense of privacy, rather than being on top of each other. There's also space to have 2 separate work from home areas without using any of the rooms, which helps separate work from home life; and 4) Proximity to multiple local parks and shops.

The area to the west of the High Road, near Alexandra Palace, was developed as a mainly middle-class residential area, whereas the area to the east, towards Tottenham, mainly comprises smaller dwellings that were either built for railway workers in the 19th century or as social housing in the 20th. The high street and the shopping mall host a variety of shops. There are regeneration plans approved for the old Marks and Spencer, and bhs buildings. There are a number of new restaurants which have opened along the High Street in recent years. Behind the high street, Wood Green's streets include a high proportion of attractive high-quality Victorian houses. To the north and west of the tube station, a large number of green spaces weave through the streets and a number of larger open green areas remain<br><br>Wood Green is especially popular with families thanks to the plenty of green spaces and good local schools.
